    <h1><em>Java Scanner Tool</em></h1>
    <p>When wanting to accept user input in a Java program, it is
      common for developers to import the <strong>java.util.Scanner</strong>
      tool. But what does it mean to "import" this tool?</p>
    <p>The <strong>java</strong> package is a universal file available
      to Java programers that contains several packages. A "package" is
      a container for a class, which means it holds the predefined tools
      we wish to import. </p>
    <p>The <strong>util</strong> folder lives inside the java folder and
      contains utility "classes", such as the <strong>Scanner</strong>,
      a class that was created to accept user input.</p>
