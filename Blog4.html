    <h1>Pitfalls</h1>
    <p> I've been told my Achille's heel is lack of confidence.
      More than one manager I've worked under has told me, "Megan,
      you're doing a great job. You just need to be more confident." I've
      also had people who would further undermine my confidence by
      expressing it less politely. Being told to "be more confident"
      after a stressful meeting or sprint planning is a good way to
      paradoxically undermine someone who does not enjoy conflict.</p>
    <p>I think a big part of the struggle for me is that confidence is
      built on certainty, and it is hard to be certain when exploring
      something new. In fact, internally, I don't wish to be certain at
      all until I've followed the journey all the way through to its
      conclusion. To me, expressing certainty before that point adds
      the risk of close-minded bias. This is also why I've struggled in
      leadership roles. I'd rather journey <strong>with</strong> people
      rather than confidently leading them nowhere.</p>
    <p>In order to avoid this pitfall in my new journey of exploring
      software development, I need to make sure that my expecations for
      myself are reasonable. I also need to redefine my perspective on
      learning. "Learning" does not mean understanding something the
      first time. "Learning" means wrestling with an application or an
      idea that does not make sense until I find those parts of the
      concept that I was missing. "Learning" means repetition, almost
      like developming a mental muscle memory, so that I am not only
      able to execute new concepts but eventually, after much practice,
      they become instinctive. "Learning" means that <strong>"It never
      gets easier, you just get better."</strong> (Note: I would love to
      cite that quote, but as I got it from my pajama pants, I don't know
      who to reference.) "Learning" means praising myself for small
      accomplishments, not being hard on myself because I don't understand
      something right away. "Learning" means listening to others, trying
      many ways to the same answer, and knowing that I will almost never
      be the smartest person in the room. And "learning" means that I don't
      want to be.</p>
    <p>Holding me accountable will be my parents, my boyfriend, and my friends.
      Anyone who knows me well knows how good I am at getting inside my
      own head, and creating problems that didn't exist. Taking deep
      breaths, making time to relax, and stepping away from difficult
      concepts, and revisiting them, will all be key to avoid the pitfall
      of undermining my confidence in myself, and being open to
      exploring the unknown.</p>
