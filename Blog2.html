    <h1>Java Method Declaration</h1>
    <p>When declaring a method in Java, it is important to tell the
      program whether or not the method will be returning any values.
      Values can be returned in the form of any acceptable value type,
      such as a string, an integer, a double, etc. However, not all
      methods will return a value type, because it is not always
      necessary.</p>
    <p>If the program will need to take in value from another method,
      that method will need to be declared with the value type. For
      example, if a method will be returning a string value, such as
      a name, the method would be written as follows: <strong> public
      static String <em>MethodName</em>()</strong>. Please note that any parameters the
      method needs to take in would be listed in the parentheses.</p>
    <p>If no return type is needed, then the method is declared as
      <strong>void</strong>, meaning that there is no return type. In
      this example, the method would be declared as follows:
      <strong>public static void <em>MethodName</em>()</strong>.</p>
