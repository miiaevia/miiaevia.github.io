    <h1>Skill Distillery Goals</h1>
    <p>When I was growing up, my dad always dreamed that I would be an
      engineer. I know that's not a father's typical dream for his
      daughter, but my dad was an engineer himself. He graduated college
      in the early 80s as an electrical engineer, working at the
      forefront of microprocessor development, when the silicone based
      microchip had just come out as a breakthrough new development.</p>
    <p>When my dad was first learning to program, they were still using
      punchcards, in those old computers that weighed at least one, if not
      multiple, tons. Then, they were wiring harddrives by hand,
      painstakingly attaching each wire to its corresponding pin, and
      rewiring over and again with each round of debugging. He relayed
      this process in detail this past weekend, when he spotted an old
      example of this at the Air Museum in Stapleton. My mom was thrilled.</p>
    <p>As a kid, my dad worked at HP, who hosted a "Take Your Daughter
      to Work Day" every year for its employees. I don't know much about
      whether or not many companies were pushing for more women in STEM
      back in the 90s but the idea that I could be an engineer one day
      was very appealing back then. I was one of those freak kids who
      enjoyed math, and going to work with my Dad once a year was
      something I always looked forward to. The employees would organize
      activities, tours of the facility where we could see the "bunnies"
      in their sterile environment, building the chips. I would sit on
      the floor of my dad's cubicle and draw pictures of Dilbert for
      him to hang on his walls. And when my dad had meetings, I would
      be handed off to a colleage, to learn about things like binary
      math. (Isn't that how <strong>you</strong> would entertain a
      10 year old??)</p>
    <p>In High School, my school offered a course in <strong>VLSI
      (Very Large Scale Integration)</strong>, which was basically
      an overview of microprocessor design. It was then that I learned
      how very, very not visual I am. The idea was to build two
      dimensional schematics of the start/end points, resistors, clocks,
      gates, etc. and then translate these into a computer program
      that would lay them out three dimensionally. You have to follow
      rules around how wide the paths are (wide enough for an electron),
      how far away they are (enough to avoid interference), and a
      plethora of others, so that you've built and timed the paths
      you need in the small space you have. Then, after attempting this,
      you get to debug your design, and redo it. The end result, as
      my dad described, feels something like an infinite loop of
      rearranging furniture.</p>
    <p>I can't begin to describe how much I struggled with this. I
      have never been a visual thinker, so this was about as far from
      excelling at something as I'd ever been. And unfortunately, this
      experience terrified me from ever being an engineer. I sprinted
      in the opposite direction as fast as I could, which led me to
      graduate from college with a degree in anthropology, which
      required no more advanced math than I'd learned in maybe 9th grade.</p>
    <p>Somehow though, computers found me. After college, I was
      completely lost as to what my next steps were, having nothing
      except an impracticle academic degree and no experience outside of
      basic labor/service jobs. I ended up in a call center as a temp,
      recording emails, voice mails and faxes and taking inbound calls.
      Very quickly however, I was moved to a team that would be the first
      to migrate to the company's new, in-house software. Shortly after
      that, my manager realized that I was the only person on the team
      who could troubleshoot unfamiliar software, and I was given
      the added responsibility of triaging tickets for the support
      team.</p>
    <p>In short, I spent the next 3 years or so doing tech
      support, before becoming a Product Owner with the goal of helping
      to enhance and develop software. I found that, while I enjoyed
      the research and thought process behind software enhancement, I
      did <em>not</em> enjoy the politics. The trouble with working in
      Product is that the purpose of the role is conflict resolution,
      so you end up in the middle of all the office politics and
      executive opinions, regardless of your level of interest. In order
      to acheive a goal or collect agreement on a proposed new feature,
      there is a lot of inter-departmental navigation and diplomacy
      involved and while this is a skill I greatly admire, it is not
      a skill I have a strong interest in developing. Politics have never
      been my forte, and I found my stress level was steadily increasing.</p>
    <p>When condsidering my next steps, what struck me the most is how
      much I've always enjoyed working with the developers. No matter my
      role in the company, learning from the developers was always my
      favorite part of my job, and I have always admired the logic and
      tenacity with which they approached difficult problems. My
      boyfriend was the one who pointed out the obvious- the best way to
      work more closely with developers is to become a developer. Which
      led me here.</p>
    <p>The reason I've so very, <strong>very</strong> thoroughly
      expounded on my prior experience is to lay the context for why my
      future goals are still so hazy. I know that my short-term goal is
      to gain the technical accument I need to graduate from being a
      junior developer. But after that, my future is much less clear.
      I've had the relatively unique experience of approaching software
      from a more people-oriented perspective, both with users and with
      business. Because of this, I strongly suspect that I will be
      drawn back to a role that is more involved with people, because
      I know how rare it can be to find someone who both has strong
      technical skills and can speak English/business fluently to
      explain technical concerns to those who are less familiar. At the
      same time, I have no desire to reinvolve myself in office politics.
      So I'm still not sure what the future holds. But I do know that,
      for the short-term, building and developing my technical accumen
      will be my focus.</p>
