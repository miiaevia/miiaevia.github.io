    <h1>The Importance of Self-Care</h1>
    <p>When I was in High School, I was lucky enough to be taught
      something that many people don't learn until much, much later-
      the importance of self-care.</p>
    <p>I was in a Peer Counseling program that involved listening to our
      fellow students who were struggling with something, and wanted to
      talk to a peer instead of an adult. The program was led by
      Mr. Cummings, who is the best teacher I've ever had. He'd been
      running the program for several years and he spent a semester
      teaching us things like listening skills and mandatory reporting
      before letting us loose on the school. Of these lessons, the one
      I've come to rely on over the years, and will continue to use for
      the rest of my life, was on the importance of taking care of
      ourselves.</p>
    <p>In a human-centric field like counseling, it is very, very common
      for people to experience burn-out, from taking on too much and
      trying to help too many, without resting or taking care of
      themselves. However, this can be more widely applied to any
      stress-inducing situation. The crux of the lesson is this-
      only <strong>we</strong> are responsible for ourselves so only
      <strong>we</strong> can ensure that we take care of ourselves. No
      one else will do this for us.</p>
    <p>The takeaway from this lesson is important. It means that we
      do not need to feel guilty whenever we need to take a step back
      from something or someone in order to rest and replenish our
      internal resources. Only we can meet this need and we have a
      responsibility to ourselves to do so. Stepping back temporarily from
      a challenging problem is also in our benefit, as unintuitive as
      that may seem. When problem-solving, it is common for people to
      work themselves into a loop, and repeat it fruitlessly, exhausting
      ourselves with no progress made towards a solution. Stepping back
      allows our sub-conscious to chew on the problem on its own, so that
      when we come back to it, there may well be a solution we hadn't
      thought of before, because we were stuck in our head.</p>
    <p>To sum up, is it important to take care of ourselves, so
      that we can continue to press on long-term. Not only is it
      unnecessary to feel guilty for taking care of ourselves, but it
      also benefits those around us, as well as the problem we are trying
      to solve. So as we dive into new territory and take on bigger
      challenges, remember- you are responsible for taking care of
      <strong>you</strong>!</p>
